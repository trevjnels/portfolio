        <p>I am an obsessive and relentless tinkerer and have an unlimited thirst for new information with a strong appreciate for symmetry balance and natural patterns. I read thoroughly too much about the world and like to get caught up in the
          details. I am a mostly self-taught developer with an enterprise sales background. That said I was destined for engineering as child but was thrown off track. I had all the signs of a young steampunk Jedi: setting up the family computer at
          5yo, becoming a mechanical pencil modder in 1st grade, spending much of my childhood solo in my dad’s workshop in the basement, and leading my physics/geometry/math
          classes without even trying. </p>
        <p>At the ripe age of 12 on a sunny afternoon, I met a mechanical engineer - well a whole bunch of them - in a hot tub in Disney World. They were attending an industry conference. This downtrodden and dissatisfied man told me that
          engineering was a miserable pursuit and to find greener pastures. At that point I stoped focusing on building. I’ve now seen what its like to do what you do not love for money, Now I'm fixing that and building.
          When not coding, I'm summiting mountains and if(winter){c(snowboarding down them)};.</p>
