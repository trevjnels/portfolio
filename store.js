Overall I'm happy with the outcome and I'm sure I'll improve it and refactor. One special highlight is that both of the borders are randomized everytime  the screen is resized (try it) or whenver the user interacts with the nav bar.",

I got sick of creating the same boilerplate for my jQuery projects with flexbox so I made a starting point called starterkit. I'll be making a react version soon. This app will provide you with results of national parks for specific states selected.",
